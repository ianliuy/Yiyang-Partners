As a seasoned hedge fund manager, I have distilled a set of 16 criteria for identifying outstanding listed companies over my many years in the investment industry. These criteria seem to be tailor-made for greatcompanies, perfectly fitting enterprises like [Kweichow Moutai](https://www.google.com/search?q=kweichow+moutai+stock). Now, let's delve into these 16 "golden rules" one by one.

#### 1. A Deep and Wide "Moat"
An exceptional company must possess a deep, wide, and difficult-to-cross "moat" that effectively prevents competitors from eroding its monopolistic profits. This "moat" can be unique technology, patents, brands, channels, etc., which together form a solid barrier, laying the foundation for the company's long-term prosperity.

#### 2. Dominance in the Industry
The company should hold a monopolistic position in its industry, becoming the undisputed leader. Monopoly not only implies higher pricing power and profit margins but also stronger risk resistance. When the industry experiences fluctuations, the leading enterprises can often leverage their scale and resource advantages to recover first and seize opportunities.

#### 3. High Return on Equity (ROE)
The company should maintain a high return on equity (ROE). We can use the DuPont analysis model to break down ROE into net profit margin, total asset turnover, and equity multiplier. This gives rise to three profit models: high gross margin model (Moutai), high turnover model (Walmart), and high leverage model (Vanke). Among them, the high gross margin model is the most ideal and stable.

#### 4. Product Pricing Power
The products of exceptional companies should have pricing power, with sales volume continuing to grow even when prices increase. This means that the company controls the market initiative, and consumers have high loyalty and stickiness to its products, not abandoning them due to price hikes. This is an important reflection of the company's core competitiveness.

#### 5. Products in High Demand
The company's products are in short supply, with consumers clamoring for them. This not only ensures the company's sales performance but also enhances its bargaining power, reducing reliance on channels and customers. When a product becomes a "blockbuster," the company gains market dominance.

#### 6. Abundant Cash Flow
The company has abundant cash flow and good accounts receivable turnover. This indicates that its profits are of "high quality," its financial condition is stable, and its working capital management is proper. The abundance of cash flow also provides a guarantee for the company's long-term development, allowing it to seize investment opportunities with ease.

#### 7. Strong Product Differentiation
The company's products have strong differentiation attributes that are difficult for competitors to imitate and replace. Differentiation stems from innovation; unique formulas, craftsmanship, design, etc., can all endow products with inimitable characteristics. This differentiation is the cornerstone of building long-term competitive advantage.

#### 8. Products That Make Consumers "Addicted"
The products of exceptional companies can make consumers "addicted," building strong brand loyalty. Products like Moutai liquor, iPhone, Coca-Cola, etc., have become integral to consumers' daily lives. This "addictive" attribute provides the company with a loyal customer base.

#### 9. Appreciating Inventory
The company's inventory does not depreciate over time; instead, it appreciates like Moutai liquor. This breaks the traditional concept of inventory being a "burden," transforming it from a cost to a source of income. The appreciation potential of inventory also highlights the scarcity and collectible value of the company's products.

#### 10. Excellent Brand Reputation
The company's brand is widely known, enjoying a high level of recognition and reputation. An excellent brand is a company's most valuable intangible asset, condensing years of accumulated goodwill. The brand premium ability will help the company stand out and gain an edge in competition.

#### 11. Simple and Efficient Business Model
The company has a simple and efficient business model that can easily achieve "making money, making real money, and making money while lying down." The business model determines the company's cash generation ability. An excellent model should be highly compatible with industry characteristics and be able to continuously create value in an automated and intelligent manner.

#### 12. Cost Advantage Against Inflation
The company is not affected by fluctuations in raw material prices, and its gross profit margin can remain high for years. This is due to the company's ability to control upstream costs and the high added value of its own products. In an era of rising commodity prices, the company can still maintain a steady and rising profit margin through price increases and upgrades.

#### 13. Longevity and Timelessness
The company can continue to operate for decades or even centuries without decline, and its products are almost irreplaceable. They often represent an era, a culture, and remain fresh and vibrant. This longevity also indicates that the enterprise has a lasting foundation and enduring value.

#### 14. Asset-Light, High Returns
Exceptional companies require little investment in fixed assets, yet can continuously create substantial cash flows. This means that the company's production efficiency is extremely high, and capital utilization is very lean. Being asset-light allows the company to focus on its core business and flexibly respond to market changes.

#### 15. Strong Product Pricing Power
The company has strong pricing power over its products and can increase profits through price hikes without relying excessively on sales growth. This pricing power reflects the high quality and scarcity of the products, and consumers are willing to pay for it. It creates an "invisible barrier" for the company.

#### 16. Nearly Perpetual Cash Flow
The company's cash flow is stable and continuous, requiring almost no large capital expenditures to obtain nearly perpetual free cash flow. This is the fundamental source of the company's value. The attribute of being a cash cow will bring rich long-term returns to investors.

The above 16 criteria can be regarded as the "golden rules" for exceptional listed companies. When we evaluate a company, we can refer to this checklist to see how many criteria they meet. The more items they match, the higher the company's investment value and the more worthy it is for us to hold for the long term. Conversely, if a company doesn't match at all, we can skip it and turn our attention to more promising targets. These are some of my insights and experiences from many years in the consumer goods investment field.

# Invest in the Bear Market

Today, I would like to delve into the concept of investing during a bear market. First off, let's briefly understand the bull and bear market cycles in the US. These cycles are distinct, typically spanning 9 to 11 years, encompassing phases of interest rate hikes and cuts. While rate hikes do not equate to bear markets, they indeed serve as a significant precursor. Bear markets often coincide with economic crises. Comparatively, identifying bull and bear market cycles is relatively straightforward in the US.

The art of investing largely revolves around finding good companies and purchasing them at fair prices. During bull markets, we tend to find that the stock prices of good companies are often very high, as many investors, not just us, can see the value in these firms. Our goal is not to chase low prices, but to seek reasonable prices. Even if the price is slightly high, it's acceptable, but it should never be exorbitantly high. The stock prices of good companies are usually not very cheap, but our objective is to buy within a reasonable price range.

So, why should we choose to invest during a bear market? The core reason is that many good companies have relatively lower stock prices during a bear market. Stock prices are typically driven by market sentiment and a company’s earnings. If we can foresee a company's future earnings, the risk in investing will be significantly reduced. In a bear market, due to depressed market sentiment and hampered corporate earnings, we often find reasonably or even undervalued quality companies.

Taking a famous Chinese liquor brand as an example, its stock price peaked in 2007 but plummeted during the financial crisis, only recovering to the 2007 level in 2015— a span of 8 years. This example clearly illustrates the importance of timing when buying. The stock prices of good companies will always bounce back as long as their fundamentals remain intact. Selling a good company at a low price point is a wrong choice. Indeed, selling a good company at any time is incorrect.

Investing in a bear market is exhilarating because we can purchase good companies at relatively lower prices. Conversely, during bull markets, stock prices are generally higher, making companies’ financial statements appear more attractive, but liquidity transmission is also quicker. Bull and bear markets not only affect investors' sentiments; they materially impact a company’s value and earnings. In the long run, the focus of investing should be on finding good companies with sustainable growth prospects. As long as the investment targets have a likelihood of continued existence in the future, the actual investment risk is not much of an issue.

In summary, bear markets present us with golden investment opportunities, allowing us to acquire good companies at reasonable prices. Both bull and bear markets have their respective investment strategies, but our core philosophy remains unchanged: seek and invest in good companies with long-term growth potential, maintain a long-term investment perspective, and invest within a suitable price range. Through this approach, we can capture true value in bear markets, laying a solid foundation for future growth.
